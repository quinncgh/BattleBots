# BattleBotsTemplate

# version 3 of th bot:
The second version of the bot will create users 

The we will create content by emotion by batch, each batch will have a list of content focus on one topic and one emotion. Each batch of content will be stored in a structure. 

After all the batch of the contents are created, then we loop (both the user and the contents) to assign the content to the user

# Implementation of the third version
The created users will send to main so it cannot add the field "personality", so this version will assign the user a personality when we add the content to the user list. (But we do can add a feature to determine the users' personality based on username but not on this version)then the program will choose the content list with correspond emotion and randomly choose the posts to added for the user


numerical standard: each user will have 30 posts to accomodate sentiment class number account (to satifity a certain number of emotions), simpsonDiversityIndex(the probability that draw 2 post that with same emotion), and ShannonWienerIndex,
so as long as we have generated the posts with different sentiment, we will assign the posts by reverse engineering the above index 



# Notes for the version 3
1. This version will disgard the correlations between the username and their content, the username is generated by the gpt based on the given examples, meaning the name does not shows the interests, intention, perferences on a topic etc. This might be modified for the next version
